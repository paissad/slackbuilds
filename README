Hi folks,

Here are some of my SlackBuilds for Slackware.

###########################################################################
Before use, remember that YOU ARE AT YOUR OWN RISK! Don't blame me if your
system explodes or suffer any other bad things.

If you want use one of them, fakeroot package installed is recommended (you can
find it in www.slackbuilds.org). With that, it's
possible to run the SlackBuilds as normal user. Creating a user only for this
task is very important too. 

Requirements section in SlackBuilds do not show true requirements, it is used
 more as reference than speak the truth. :)

The "exit 1" or "shellout" function are in for a reason, do not remove them! If
 a SB do not finish correctly, try to figure out the problem.

Some download links are broken, so, if this happens, you may search source files by yourself.

I either wrote myself or re-edited from another SlackBuild already 
( slackbuilds.org for example )or even from the slackware ISO image.

paissad.SlackBuild is a generic SlackBuild i use to create other ones.

You should read the license for each software before using it :-)

Hope, these scripts will be useful for you.
