Just run 'fakeroot xtables-addons.SlackBuild' in order to download & build the slackware package.
This will build the package for the current running kernel $(uname -r)
But if you want to build the package for another kernel, just set the local env variable KERNEL,
here is an example:
KERNEL=2.6.36.1 fakeroot xtables-addons.SlackBuild

Enjoy,
