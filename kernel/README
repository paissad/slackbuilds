After running the slackbuild
The following packages will be created:

kernel-huge-$VERSION-x86_64-1_****
kernel-modules-$VERSION-x86_64-1_****
kernel-headers-$VERSION-x86_64-1_****
kernel-firmware-$VERSION-noarch-1_****
kernel-source-$VERSION-noarch-1_****
kernel-docs-$VERSION-noarch-1_**** (if $BUILD_DOCS=yes)

You should install in this order
1 ->  kernel-$KERN_NAME( where $KERN_NAME = huge, generic or whatever ), 
2 ->  kernel-modules 
3 ->  kernel-headers
After you may install as you want..

Create an initrd image if you want or need one.
Read /boot/README.initrd

Don't forget to configure & run lilo too.

Enjoy !
