XBMC is an award winning media center application for Linux, Mac OS X,
Windows and XBox. The ultimate hub for all your media, XBMC is easy to
use, looks slick, and has a large helpful community.  XBMC supports
viewing and playing a vast library of audio, video and image formats.
XBMC has a sophisticated library management system that allows you to
organize all your media to give you quick and immediate access.

XBMC requires faad2, libmms and enca.

Optional: vobcopy, lirc, faac, SDL_gfx, cwiid, pybluez,
lightblue, libvdpau and avahi.  Starting with version 9.11 XBMC can
be built with additional system libraries which are ffmpeg, libmpeg2,
libdca (aka libdts), a52dec (aka liba52) libass and python (all available
at slackbuilds.org or included in Slackware).  Look inside the slackbuild
for additional information to turn these options on.

In order to use a Wii remote with XBMC pass USE_WII=yes to the
slackbuild. This now makes cwiid a build requirement and also requires
pybluez or lightblue for bluetooth support.
